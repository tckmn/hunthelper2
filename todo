new server setup???
update docs
race condition: can create puzzle twice
when making puzzles really fast sometimes some queries don't get sent by sheets ("reconcile" operation?)
manual operations to fix errors
special puzzles not in rounds (e.g. scavenger hunt)
morse/a1/etc commands
auto refresh hint pages and send messages about hint status
hint queue that auto prints next hint to hint coordination channel
auto delete stray content in link columns
test suite that is allowed destructive actions
automate who's working on puzzle by sheets users active
also pingable version of above
metadata in puzzle sheets, maybe in separate tab
automatically clear people/location when solved
